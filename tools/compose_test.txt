Compose dynamic test scenarios by intelligently combining multiple flows.

This tool acts as a test planner that analyzes your testing requirements and automatically selects the appropriate flows from QA_FLOWS.json to create a comprehensive test plan.

How it works:
1. Analyzes your test description using keywords and intent
2. Matches against available flows in the flows library
3. Auto-includes prerequisites (e.g., login flows)
4. Sequences flows in logical order
5. Provides execution plan with timing estimates

Matching Strategies:
- Test categories (smoke, regression, critical path)
- Feature keywords (call logs, appointments, dashboard)
- Action verbs (view, add, edit, delete, search, filter)
- Composite journeys (end-to-end workflows)
- CRUD operations (comprehensive feature testing)

Parameters:
- testDescription: What you want to test in natural language
- includeLogin: Auto-add login flow if needed (default: true)
- maxFlows: Limit number of flows (default: 10)
- priorityFilter: Filter by priority level (critical/high/medium/low/all)

Example Queries:

Test Categories:
- "smoke tests" → Runs all smoke testing flows
- "critical path" → Runs all critical path flows
- "regression tests" → Runs full regression suite

Feature Testing:
- "test call logs functionality" → All call log flows
- "verify appointment CRUD" → Add, edit, delete appointment flows
- "test dashboard features" → All dashboard interaction flows

Specific Workflows:
- "complete call management workflow" → End-to-end call journey
- "test search and filter in call logs" → Search + filter flows
- "verify all button actions work" → Action-specific flows

Action-Based:
- "test adding and editing appointments" → add + edit flows
- "verify viewing call details" → view detail flows

Output:
- List of selected flows in execution order
- Priority levels and descriptions
- Total estimated duration
- Required parameters
- Execution commands

This tool is useful for:
- Planning comprehensive test scenarios
- Understanding flow dependencies
- Creating custom test suites
- Estimating test execution time
- Discovering related flows
