Resolve natural language element descriptions to CSS selectors using anchor points.

This tool acts as an intelligent translator between human-friendly element descriptions and precise CSS selectors. It queries the QA_ANCHOR_POINTS.json blueprint to find the correct selector patterns for your application.

How it works:
1. Analyzes your natural language description
2. Searches through anchor points for matching patterns
3. Returns the most confident selector match
4. Provides alternatives if multiple matches exist

Supported Element Types:
- Buttons (primary, action, icon-based)
- Inputs (text, email, password, select, checkbox, radio, switch, date)
- Tables (rows, cells, headers, pagination)
- Dialogs/Modals (container, title, close button)
- Navigation items
- Search/filter controls
- Chips/badges/tags
- Framework-specific components (NextUI, shadcn/ui)

Parameters:
- description: Natural language description of the element
- context: Optional page/section context (e.g., "call logs page")
- returnAll: Return all matches instead of just the best one (default: false)

Example Queries:

Simple Elements:
- "Add Appointment Type button"
- "email input"
- "save button"
- "close dialog button"

With Context:
- "status chip in first row"
- "search input in call logs"
- "view details button"

Complex Descriptions:
- "checkbox in row 3"
- "button with copy icon"
- "input with placeholder 'Search'"

Advanced:
- resolve_selector("Add button", context="appointment types page")
- resolve_selector("status dropdown", returnAll=true)

Output:
- Best matching selector with confidence score
- Source location in anchor points
- Description of the element
- Alternative selectors (if any)
- Usage examples

This tool is helpful for:
- Writing custom test scenarios
- Debugging selector issues
